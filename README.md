# ðŸ§  DSA Interview Blueprints

This repo is my structured, pattern-first guide to mastering data structures and algorithms for Big Tech coding interviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Solve problems by **recognizing patterns**, not memorizing solutions
- Create a **template-driven toolkit** for fast recall under pressure
- Build a second brain of **reusable insights**, not cluttered code

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each pattern has:
- âœ… Core decision matrix
- âœ… Minimal code templates
- âœ… Linked LeetCode problems
- âœ… Tradeoffs, edge cases, smart comments

## ðŸ“š Patterns Included

- `heap-patterns/` â€” top-k, ranking, proximity, simulation
- `sliding-window/` â€” fixed, dynamic, monotonic
- `two-pointers/` â€” bidirectional, partitioning
- `binary-search/` â€” on values, answers, boundaries
- `dfs-bfs/` â€” trees, graphs, cycle detection
- `greedy/` â€” activity selection, heap-based, interval merges
- `dp/` â€” 1D, 2D, state transition maps
- `graph-algos/` â€” union-find, topo sort, dijkstra
- `backtracking/` â€” permutations, subsets, constraints
